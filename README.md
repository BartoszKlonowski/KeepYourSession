This project is the Mozilla Firefox extension plugin.
<br/>It's created to keep all your opened tabs in memory so you won't be afraid to close your browser or to start a new session.

The idea is to have a simple plugin (being available in the upper-right corner) that will allow you to:
* Save the current session under specific ID or customized key
* Reopen selected session in a new browser window
* Manage your saved sessions by deleting it or modifying
